# Nanobot Swarm Game ü§ñ

A cyberpunk-themed Roblox game inspired by Bee Swarm Simulator, featuring nanobots in a digital world reminiscent of Tron and The Matrix.

## üéÆ Game Concept

Transform the honey-collecting mechanics of Bee Swarm Simulator into a high-tech digital experience where players control swarms of nanobots to collect data fragments and explore virtual networks.

### Core Theme

- **Setting**: Artificial computer world with Matrix/Tron aesthetics
- **Collectors**: Nanobots instead of bees
- **Resources**: Data Nodes, upgrade chips, and computer parts
- **Environment**: Network nodes, data sectors, digital landscapes

## üöÄ Key Features

### Nanobot Formation System

The game‚Äôs standout feature is the **Photoshop Tool-based formation control**:
# UNDER DEVELOPMENT
- **Selection Tool**: Square/rectangular formations
- **Lasso Tool**: Organic curved swarms
- **Brush Tool**: Circular formations with varying sizes
- **Pen Tool**: Precise geometric shapes
- **Text Tool**: Alphabet letter formations (A-Z)
- **Clone Stamp**: Mirrored/duplicate patterns
- **Blur Tool**: Scattered, fuzzy arrangements
- **Gradient Tool**: Linear spacing patterns

### Formation Mechanics

- **Primary Nanobot**: Central unit that other nanobots orbit around
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Formations adapt based on nanobot count (1-50 total)
- **Smooth Rotation**: Entire formation slowly rotates around the primary
- **Seamless Transitions**: Tool switching triggers smooth formation changes

### Progression Systems

- **Nanobot Evolution**: Different protocols (attack, defense, collection) 
- **Motherboard/Mainframe**: Base management system
- **Network Exploration**: Various data sectors to unlock
- **Digital Economy**: Data as currency!

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Current Status

- Base game mechanics adapted from open-source Bee Swarm model
- Existing shop and item systems in place
- Force-based movement system already implemented
- Working on formation controller system

### Planned Features

- [ ] Photoshop tool formation system
- [ ] Scalable formation algorithms
- [ ] Smooth transition animations
- [ ] Tool-specific gameplay mechanics
- [ ] Cyberpunk visual effects
- [ ] Digital sound design

## üéØ Target Audience

Players who enjoy:

- Incremental/idle games
- Swarm management mechanics
- Cyberpunk aesthetics
- Creative formation systems
- Roblox simulator games

## üîß Development Notes
